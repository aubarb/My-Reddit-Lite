# My Reddit Lite

My Reddit Lite is a light version of the Reddit website made to fit my needs and interests: https://my-reddit-l.web.app/

## Description

This app is linked to the official Reddit website throught the JSON API.
After fetching the data, if filters and displays only the information that I am intertested in.

The goal of this project was to make my own version of Reddit that would give me all the content I need (and nothing more) in the layout that I want.

I used HTML, CSS, JS and React to make this app. Some challenges faced during the project include the understanding and sorting of the great amount of data received from the API.

More features that I would like to implement in the future include:

- Saving posts to a "favorite" storage
- Add more filters
